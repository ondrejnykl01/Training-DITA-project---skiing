    <title>Skate ski track</title>
    <shortdesc>How the cross country ski track dedicated to skate style looks like and how to use
        it.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Well the skate ski track looks like this:<image placement="break"
                href="../images/skate_ski_track.jpg" id="image_rwt_ptk_rgc" scale="50"/></p>
        <p>Nice, isn't it? The surface is called man≈æestr... But this manchester is not produced in
            manchester. Instead, it's created this way:<image placement="break"
                href="../images/ski_plow_cross_country.jpg" id="image_apl_sfk_tgc" scale="35"/>Of
            course, this plow also makes the classic ski track - it's good to be tolerant and care
            about our weak.</p>
