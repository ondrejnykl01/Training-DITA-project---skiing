        <p>The cross-country ski track is delivered in two forms. First of them is called "classic"
            and basically looks like two chemins d'Ã©carts in the snow. The other one consists just
            of plowed snow of at least 2 meters width which leads somewhere. It's called "skate
            track". The differences of these two types are caused by the existence of two different
            techniques of cross-country skiing. Each of the track type is dedicated to one of these
            techniques. For more detail, please find other topics.</p>
